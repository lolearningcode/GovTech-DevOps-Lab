# üõ°Ô∏è GovTech DevOps Lab

Welcome to the **GovTech DevOps Lab** ‚Äî a hands-on portfolio of secure, automated, and compliance-aware infrastructure projects designed for federal cloud environments.

Each project demonstrates real-world skills required for U.S. Government contracts, including **FISMA**, **FedRAMP**, **CMMC**, and **NIST 800-53** compliance alignment.

Built using **Terraform**, **AWS**, **Ansible**, **GitHub Actions (OIDC)**, and security tools like **tfsec**, **Checkov**, and **Trivy**.

- Infrastructure-as-Code skills aligned with **government controls**
- Secure AWS deployments with **audit trails and zero trust**
- CI/CD pipelines that pass **compliance scanning and hardening**
- DevSecOps mindset from **design to deployment**
